1. When should the private methods be used in a class?
- It is useful where we perform operations on sensitive data.
  e.g. - Database operation code.

2. Do we need encapsulation for constants?
- We don't need encapsulation for constants because no one can change or update constants.

3. What are two benefits of using the Factory methods?
- It prevent the direct creation of object

4. Overloading is compile time or runtime?
- It is compile time.

5. What are the three ways of initializing instance variables?
- Using instance block
- Using constructor

6. What is constructor chaining, write a program to show it.
- Constructor chaining is a process of calling a constructor from another constructor.
- For constructor chaining, the first statement of constructor should this() for calling another constructor of same class, and super() for for calling constructor for parent class

7. Use a non-static initialization block to show its use.
- It is same as constructor but it calls every when object is created even if object is created by different parameter constructor.
- Instance block calls before constructor.

8. Use a static initialization block to show its use.
- Static block calls only once during the loading of class.

9. Why "finalize" method is deprecated?
- finalize method calls before when object is destroy, it is deprecated because of unnecessary behavior, it does not calls always when object destroy.

10. What is the proper way of naming a package in java, show using an example.
- Package name should be written in lower case.
- <domain name in reverse order> . <module name> . <application name>

11. What is a "import static".
- With static import we don't need specify class name before using content(method, variable), We can directly write method name or variable name.

12. What are the various class design guidelines.
- If class has to many responsibilities then break it into multiple classes
- Data should be private
- name of class or method should be reflect to their role.
- number of lines in method should not be more than 35-40 lines.
